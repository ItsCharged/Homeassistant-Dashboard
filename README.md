***My Homeassistant (Tablet) Dashboard***

This was created by using a lot of custom ressources. I recommend you checking them out. (look below)

There are 2 release options: Redacted and not redacted.
The diffrence between them, is that one uses (not redacted) shows all my entitys and my config (some entitys / configs have been redacted anyways, for privacy reasons.)
The redacted one only shows Template cards which you can change and fit to your liking. It shows basic ways to animate, using (adaptive) icons and colors.
I mainly use the normal cards for turning things on/off and for opening popups.

For Wallpanel there is a nice integration named wallpanel but personally i like fully kiosk more. You pay one time, but i think its worth it. Fully has got a lot of features like hass communication, motion detection, very good error of website detection (shows when offline reconnects when online tries to reconnect to wifi network) and a ton of more features i cant put in this description so go check out both of them and see whats better for you :)

Simple weather card (For weather in the sidebar and yes there are 2-3 weather cards in this dashboard. Trust me all of them make sense!)

Kiosk Mode (Yes this is required in homeassistant to disable the sidebar and header so it  doesent look ugly. In a web browser you can disable the kiosk mode by adding ?disable_km behind the url Example: https[:]//yourhassinstance[.]duckdns[.]org/dashboard-tablet/Standard-Room/***?disable_km***)
