***My Homeassistant Dashboard***

This was created by using a lot of custom ressources. I recommend you checking them out. (look below)

There are 2 release options: Redacted and not redacted.
The diffrence between them, is that one uses (not redacted) shows all my entitys and my config (some entitys / configs have been redacted anyways, for privacy reasons.)
The redacted one only shows Template cards which you can change and fit to your liking. It shows basic ways to animate, using (adaptive) icons and colors.
I mainly use the normal cards for turning things on/off and for opening popups.
